This repository contains some sample data analytical work and visualizations that I did for class assignments or projects.

This link (https://jvjvj.shinyapps.io/ev-station-map/) also goes to a web app I built that lets you see locations of electric vehicles charging stations in U.S. and Canda by state and over time.
